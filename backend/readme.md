# Backend

Currently, the backend is written in TypeScript, since this
server logic has [already been written in JavaScript, once](https://github.com/ZombieHippie/FreeSketch/blob/gh-pages/server.js).

We will learn from what we do in Elm to construct the backend
in Elixir, and then eventually with flatbuffer support for the
drawing commands.
